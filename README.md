# itsalamp
It is what the name says: a lamp. The idea is to be able to control the icon through the stdin, so that a program can display permanent notifications that do not popup.

## Compiling

If you have `gtk+2` installed, just run `make`. The executable will be written to the `bin` folder.
For debug symbols, use `make debug`.
